## Client Background and Pain Points

**Client Name:** Uncle Thomas

**Role:** Minimart owner with several chains in the neighborhood.

**Age:** 60+

### Pain Points

1. **Loyal Customer Loss:**
   Uncle Thomas is concerned about losing loyal customers who have moved away from the area where his physical store is located. He believes these customers are also unhappy about not being able to support his business, which they have enjoyed for its friendly service.

2. **Business Succession and Modernization:**
   As Uncle Thomas ages, he is eager to pass his business on to his children. However, his children are hesitant to take over due to:

   - **Business Model Concerns:** They do not believe that the current business model will grow and are concerned that it may not be sustainable in the long term, especially with the rise of e-commerce.
   - **E-Commerce Interest:** They suggest that if Uncle Thomas invests in e-commerce, they would be more interested in taking over and managing that aspect of the business.
